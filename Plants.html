    <p> Some people might say I have too many plants. <strong>BUT</strong> I would say I still have plenty of room for more plants. <br> I mean look at them, dont you just wanna go buy some more plants! <br> I will say though, it is because of the amount of plants that I have that I often catch myself thinking about how to better care for each plant individually,</p>
